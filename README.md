# SimpleFoundation

![SimpleFoundation Architecture](docs/images/architecture-diagram.svg)

A simplified, affordable implementation for training and running your own foundational language model with reasoning capabilities, inspired by [NovaSky-AI's Sky-T1](https://novasky-ai.github.io/posts/sky-t1/).

## 🚀 Overview

SimpleFoundation is an end-to-end system for training foundation models with a focus on reasoning capabilities in math and coding domains. This project aims to make advanced AI research more accessible by providing a clear, documented implementation that can be run on modest hardware.

### Key Features

- **Complete Pipeline**: Data collection, solution generation, quality filtering, training, evaluation, and serving
- **Cost-Efficient**: Optimized for training on consumer hardware (~$500 or less on cloud providers)
- **Strong Reasoning**: Targets math and coding reasoning capabilities like larger commercial models
- **Well-Documented**: Clear code, architecture diagrams, and step-by-step guides
- **Modular Design**: Components can be used independently or as a complete system

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Train a 7B parameter model with reasoning capabilities in 12-24 hours on consumer hardware
- Achieve performance comparable to much larger commercial models on specific reasoning tasks
- Interactive demo UI for exploring model capabilities
- Comprehensive benchmarking on math and coding problems
- Clear pathway to extend the system with your own data and tasks

## 📋 Requirements

### Minimal Hardware (Training smaller models)
- 1 GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (e.g., RTX 3090, A5000)
- 32GB+ RAM
- 100GB+ SSD storage

### Recommended Hardware (Training 7B+ models)
- 4-8 GPUs with 24GB+ VRAM each (e.g., RTX 4090, A100)
- 128GB+ RAM
- 1TB+ SSD storage

## 🧰 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleFoundation.git
cd SimpleFoundation

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For detailed installation instructions, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

SimpleFoundation provides an all-in-one solution with `main.py` that can run the entire pipeline or individual components:

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline (data → train → evaluate → serve)
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode full

# OR run individual components:

# 1. Data Pipeline Only
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode data

# 2. Training Only
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode train

# 3. Evaluation Only
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode eval --model_path checkpoints/your_model/final

# 4. Start the Inference Server
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode serve --model_path checkpoints/your_model/final

# 5. Launch the Demo UI
python main.py --config configs/default.yaml --mode demo
```

## 🔧 Customization

SimpleFoundation is designed to be easily customizable:

- **Data**: Add your own datasets or problem types in `data/collectors/`
- **Models**: Change base models by modifying the configuration in `configs/default.yaml`
- **Training**: Adjust hyperparameters in the configuration file
- **Evaluation**: Create custom benchmarks in `evaluation/benchmarks/`
- **Inference**: Extend the API server in `inference/server/`

## 📊 Performance
